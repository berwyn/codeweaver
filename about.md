I'm a software engineer currently working at as a
{{ site.data.jobs[0].position }} at {{ site.data.jobs[0].name }}, but the
contents of this site represent my own opinions.

I've worked in Java, C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, CoffeeScript
(seeing a trend there?), Go, Ruby, Rust, Python and a little bit
of Haskell. I'm a particular fan of functional programming, the
observable pattern, promises instead of callbacks, strong types,
and duck typing.

I'm very fond of Angular JS, I like my Sinatra clones, I've been
playing with ASP.NET vNext lately and really loving it, I have
a great desire to learn iOS and Windows' Universal App Platform,
and some day, I might learn to tolerate Electron.

That's me in a nutshell. Who are you? Give me a holler, let's chat!
