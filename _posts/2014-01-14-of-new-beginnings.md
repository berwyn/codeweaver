So, I've finally done it. I _finally_ started this blog. After months, nay, _years_ of delaying starting
a blog,
I finally got around to it. And from this, there are lessons to be learned!

<!-- break -->

1. Reinventing wheels is for fun and education, not serious works
2. Existing tools exist for a reason
3. [Jekyll][jekyll] is cool
4. [Side][masterdex] [projects][faye] [are][eqbeats-android] [the][codeweaver] [bane][tyrian-explorer-chrome] [of][mlfw] [my][project-euler] [existence][pony-express]
5. Writing is hard. Substance takes time and many, many, _many_ rewrites
6. Senioritis is the worst affliction

Anyway, it's started, it's out there, it's a thing! I'm going to try to write here semi-regularly on all
sorts of topics (though, you'll
mainly see things like code, code, maybe some more code, some sarcasm, and maybe a small pastel-coloured
horse or two). I'll also be tweaking the theme to better suit my tastes, but for now I can leave this one
alone.

For those interested in the mechanics of it, it's built on Jekyll, with [mmistakes'][mmistake] [HPSTR][hpstr]
theme running on GitHub Pages. You can check out the [source code][source] if you're so inclined.

Cheers, and until next time.
