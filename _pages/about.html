<p>
    I'm a software engineer currently working at as a
    {{ site.data.jobs[0].position }} at {{ site.data.jobs[0].name }}, but the
    contents of this site represent my own opinions.
</p>
<p>
    I've worked in Java, C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, CoffeeScript
    (seeing a trend there?), Go, Ruby, Rust, Python and a little bit
    of Haskell. I'm a particular fan of functional programming, the
    observable pattern, promises instead of callbacks, strong types,
    and duck typing.
</p>
<p>
    I'm very fond of Angular JS, I like my Sinatra clones, I've been
    playing with ASP.NET vNext lately and really loving it, I have
    a great desire to learn iOS and Windows' Universal App Platform,
    and some day, I might learn to tolerate Electron.

    That's me in a nutshell. Who are you? Give me a holler, let's chat!

<div class="jobs">
    <h1 class="page-header">Employment</h1>
    <ul class="job-list">
        {% for job in site.data.jobs %}
            <li class="card inline-card">
                <div class="card-hero">
                    <img src="{{ job.icon }}" alt="{{ job.name | prepend: site.url }}">
                </div>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <h4 class="card-title">{{ job.position }}</h4>
                    <h5 class="card-subtitle">{{ job.name }}</h5>
